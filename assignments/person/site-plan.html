      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I wanted to create a website where people could trade game accounts freely. The existing account trading platform has some shortcomings. Such as a small number of accounts, unable to accurately search for the desired items or too complicated to sell accounts. So I wanted to create a website that could solve these problems.

      <p>Everyone who wants to buy or sell an account</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        about my first page   
       </p>
       <p>
         First of all, I want my front page to be clean and simple so that people who visit my site can focus on searching for the game or game item they want. You should also have a prominent link icon on the main page. Popular game ICONS are displayed after people click on them. Each icon is a link that people click on to show a popular account or item for that game.
         People will visit my site rather than other sites because it is a specialized provide the game account site, and the site will have a more comprehensive search system, let people accurate searching for an item in the game, then the website will provide with the item's account, can make people focus on what you want items, Rather than trying to find the one you want from a bunch of accounts.
       <p>
         what people should do to use my website
       </p>
       <p>Second, it's a simple registration process that allows users to log in via the big social platforms. After completing the registration, people only need to associate a bank account, which can provide funds in and out, so that users can freely trade game accounts.</p>
       <p>
         what people can get from my website
       </p>
       <p>Third, I want visitors to be able to sell or buy the game account they want when they visit my site. After visiting the website, people can first search whether there is a game account they want in the website. After confirming that there is a game account they want, they can complete their information through a quick registration. After completing their account information, users can buy or sell game accounts.</p>
